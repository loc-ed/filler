# filler
The goal of this project is to code an AI for the game of Filler, for which we have a virtual machine.


First of all run git submodule init, then git submodule update. Then run make to obtain the player. To see it in action, run the VM (you will need to download it):

./res/filler_vm -f res/maps/map00 -p1 filler -p2 res/players/superjeannot.filler
